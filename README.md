# minoposd
Modified version of the original minOPOSD for OpenPilot. Original available at https://code.google.com/p/minoposd/.
Thanks JR63, your work for original version is highly appreciated!

Main points:
* OpenPilot version 15.05 is supported.
* Arduino IDE 1.0.6 needs to be used with this. Versions beyond 1.0.6 might not be compatible.

Rest of the documentation to be added later on ...
